## Will you be implementing terrain generation?
Yes! It is not currently on our list of priorities, and it is very unlikely that we will be able to mirror Vanilla world generation 1:1. However, we do plan on implementing some form of terrain generation as soon as we can.

## What does 'FerrumC' mean?
It's a play on words. Ferrum is the Lain word for iron and it ***rusts***. And MC (Minecraft) is in the end. So it becomes Ferru*mc*. Get it?

## How does this project differ from:
1. **[Valence](https://valence.rs/)**:\
    Valence is a **framework** for creating your own custom server, by pulling in various components of their library.
    FerrumC aims to be a *full replacement* for the Vanilla server implementation.

2. **[Paper](https://papermc.io/) / [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/) / [Bukkit](https://dev.bukkit.org/)**:\
    These are all fantastic server softwares and have undoubtedly set the groundwork for projects like this to exist, however they are still bound to the limitations of the original Java server implementation. We aim to write this from the ground up.

3. **[Pumpkin](https://github.com/Snowiiii/Pumpkin)**:\
    We don't differ much from Pumpkin - we have similar objectives. **We do not intend for this to be a competition**; we are both aware of each other's progress - Pumpkin's team are doing very well. We do not encourage, nor tolerate any disrespect towards them, as they are also undertaking the same monumental task as us.
